int n = 3;
int m = 4;
int result = n * (++m);

int n = 3;
int m = 4;
int result = n * (m++);


These two segments of code do NOT produce the same output. The first
segment will increment m from 4 to 5 BEFORE computing 'result'.
In that case, result will be 3*5 = 15.

The second segment of code will also increment m, but only after
result is computed. This means result will be 3*4 = 12.
In both cases, n ends up as 3, and m ends up as 5.
